How to answer questions in a smart way?

1. Don’t solve the problems, give the right tools to solve the problem – Meaning don’t just give the answer give the tools to be able to solve problems of that sort. Give the proper steps, so that if another problem arises similar to that one, the user will know the right steps to work it out themselves.

2. Better to be honest than not say anything – If someone posts a question that is really easy or can easily be found online, rather than not replying, just tell the individual “do your research”, or “easily found online”. The answer can be blunt and sometimes even harsh, but that is a good way for the person asking the question to learn to search for it on his own, which they might not originally have done.
