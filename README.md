How to answer questions in a smart way?

1. Don’t solve the problems, give the right tools to solve the problem – Meaning don’t just give the answer give the tools to be able to solve problems of that sort. Give the proper steps, so that if another problem arises similar to that one, the user will know the right steps to work it out themselves.

2. Better to be honest than not say anything – If someone posts a question that is really easy or can easily be found online, rather than not replying, just tell the individual “do your research”, or “easily found online”. The answer can be blunt and sometimes even harsh, but that is a good way for the person asking the question to learn to search for it on his own, which they might not originally have done.

##Part G Reflection

A project that greatly interests me is one called popcorn time. It is a movie streaming app, that provides new episodes and new movies at the touch of a button to many countries and many people around the world. They use many different languages and are able to supply to almost everybody in the world. I am an avid movie and tv watcher so to be able to run the source code on my own machine and be able to adjust it and fix some things up to my liking would greatly interest me. This is something I can see myself working on after this class as well. It would be great to start working and maybe fixing some of the issues with it right now. I am very intrigued and interested to learn more about how they were able to start this project and how I may be able to continue it.
